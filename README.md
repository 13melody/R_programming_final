### Project Title: R_programming_final

### Description: This repository contains practice set for Udacity Programming R Final Project. 

In this project, we explore bike-sharing systems that make available their trip data. Currently, we have bike share data from New York City, Washington DC, and Chicago. Using these data files, we can see which city has the largest quantity of bikes, which season is the most popular among bike riders, and who rent bikes more than others. 

### Files used: bikeshare.py
