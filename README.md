### Description: Bike-sharing systems make available their trip data and it is interesting to analyze it for different research and projects. Currently, we have bike share data from New York City, Washington DC, and Chicago. Using these data files, we can see which city has the largest quantity of bikes, which season is the most popular among bike riders, and who rent bikes more than others.
